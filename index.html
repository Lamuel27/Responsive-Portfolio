            <h3>About Me</h3> 
            <p>I grew up in Marshfield, WI and graduated from the University of Wisconsin - Stout with a degree in Business Administration.  I currently work at a Fintech company call ClickSWITCH.  Our company streamlines the process of switching to a new financial institution.</p>

            <p>The girl next to me in the photo is my beautiful fiance. We recently got engaged at the end of August. It is great to have her support throughout this course, especially since we cannot travel on weekends for the next 6 months.</p>
            <p>The reason I am taking this course is because my interest in development has grown since I have joined my comapany.  The first experience was with Python, automating emails that we send out each week.</p>
            <p>I believe I have a lot to contribute when it comes to building our application, so once I finish this course I hope to move to our development team.</p>           
            
            <p>Side note: My brother (Aaron Rehlinger) is also taking this course with me. So, that is pretty NEAT!</p>
